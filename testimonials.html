        "After reviewing many, many electronic charting programs for our clinic (we have between 10-20 therapists working at a time, and 90 - 120 active clients), we selected TheraNest because of its clean interface, usability, and customer service. Overall, we could not be more happy with our decision. It has been relatively easy to train our clinic staff and therapists how to use TheraNest, and the customer service representatives have always gotten back to us quickly with helpful information when we've run into small problems along the way."

        "We highly recommend Theranest! We're delighted with our service. A phone call or email is all it takes to make changes or obtain tech support. The program offers easy to use notes and everything that we have needed to expand our clinic from two clinicians to eleven! You won't find a better program and the price is a bargain!"

        "Fantastic! When opening a new private practice, I spent days searching for an online HIPPA compliant progress note and billing program. Because I do not accept insurance, I am also able to bill via client credit cards with ease, easily write progress notes, and scan in my clients intake documents and upload them to their file; scheduling is also a breeze. Customer service is wonderful, they are always available and happy to help answer questions. I highly recommend TheraNest to all counseling professionals!"

       "Theranest is a great software for non-profit counseling agency to use one system to manage our client info and records. The staff at Theranest have been very supportive to make changes to fit our needs. Overall would recommend this product for layout, ability to manage client information and case notes. Support is very good and responsive."

       "Theranest works really well for our Children's Contact Service... We are amazed with the service from these people. You ask a question and they're on to it! We had researched and tested a lot of the programs designed for welfare/family type services but most were too complicated, expensive and tricky to navigate. For $30 a month we have everything we need - calendar appointments, automatic appointment reminders (test/email), client details, invoices, case-notes, and a place to attach files. We are very happy with Theranest and will be surprised if this program doesn't become one of the most preferred. Thanks again for everything."

       "I have read reviews on products before and wondered if they were from real people! I am a real therapist in a small private practice that was growing faster than I could keep up. I tried Theranest after trying to buy another very expensive program, and I am so glad that I found Theranest. It is the perfect software storage for the small business owner. I appreciate that the cost is in direct relation to the amount of business I have. I appreciate that it does not charge by the month- by the therapist. It is solely based on client numbers. I have been using theranest now for one month and I am so pleased. All of my questions have been answered immediately by customer service and all of the answers were an easy solve! Thank you Theranest for a great - affordable- easy to use- easy to change- product! It is fantastic!!!"
