            <p>"After reviewing many, many electronic charting programs for our clinic (we have between 10-20 therapists working at a time, and 90 - 120 active clients), we selected TheraNest because of its clean interface, usability, and customer service. Overall, we could not be more happy with our decision. It has been relatively easy to train our clinic staff and therapists how to use TheraNest, and the customer service representatives have always gotten back to us quickly with helpful information when we've run into small problems along the way."</p>

            <p>"We highly recommend Theranest! We're delighted with our service. A phone call or email is all it takes to make changes or obtain tech support. The program offers easy to use notes and everything that we have needed to expand our clinic from two clinicians to eleven! You won't find a better program and the price is a bargain!"</p>

            <p>"After searching for several months for easy to use, cost-effective record keeping <a href="/private-practice-software-for-mental-health/">software for a small private practice office</a>, I was thrilled to find TheraNest. Not only is it user friendly, customer service is no less than phenomenal."</p>

            <p>"Fantastic! When opening a new private practice, I spent days searching for an online HIPPA compliant progress note and billing program. Because I do not accept insurance, I am also able to bill via client credit cards with ease, easily write progress notes, and scan in my clients intake documents and upload them to their file; scheduling is also a breeze. Customer service is wonderful, they are always available and happy to help answer questions. I highly recommend TheraNest to all counseling professionals!"</p>
