            <h4>About TheraNest</h4>
            <p>We have a simple mission: to create affordable, yet impactful software applications to help mental health professionals, and social service organizations succeed at what they do - improving outcomes for the clients they serve.</p>
            <p>Our mission was born out of a need we saw in our local community that then inspired us to create something to fill the need - great tools for social workers, therapists, psychotherapists, and other mental health professionals and their clients that are modern, updated quickly and affordable.</p>
            <p>We believe that Better Tools can enhance Better Treatments and lead to Better Outcomes</p>
