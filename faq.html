                      <p>In some cases, your cost is $0. Our approach at TheraNest is to partner with and integrate our software with multiple clearinghouses, thereby giving you more choice. We are integrated with HeW, Office Ally, and working on others. We will connect you to our clearinghouse partners for final pricing and special deals, your TheraNest account is then linked with them when you sign up and you can submit electronic claims with a couple clicks. The clearinghouses ultimately determine your cost based on your pricing with them.</p>
