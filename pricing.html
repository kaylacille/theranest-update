                  <p>There are no hidden costs to using TheraNest. However, there are additional services provided that you may choose to use such as our automated reminder service, insurance claims service, credit card processing, and data migration services. The cost of our reminder services is shown in the software based on the call locations (U.S. or International). Contact us to discuss data migration costs. They are based on volume and type of data you are migrating.</p>

                <p>In some cases, your cost is $0. Our approach at TheraNest is to partner with and integrate our software with multiple clearinghouses, thereby giving you more choice. We are integrated with HeW, Office Ally, and working on others. We will connect you to our clearinghouse partners for final pricing and special deals, your TheraNest account is then linked with them when you sign up and you can submit electronic claims with a couple clicks. The clearinghouses ultimately determine your cost based on your pricing with them.</p>
