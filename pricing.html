          <h3>How TheraNest Pricing Works</h3>
            <p>At TheraNest, we want to make organizing your practice as simple and affordable as possible. To determine your price, <b>estimate the amount of active clients you serve</b>. Not sure? That's okay! We suggest going with the lowest plan and take advantage of our 30 day free trial. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at anytime.</p>
            <p>If you need accomodations for more than 150 active users, please <a href="{{"/contact/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">contact us</a> so that we can create a plan that works for your needs.</p>
