          <h2>How TheraNest Pricing Works</h2>
            <p>At TheraNest, we want to make organizing your practice as simple and affordable as possible. To determine your price, estimate the amount of active clients you serve. Not sure? That's okay! We suggest going with the lowest plan and take advantage of our 30 day free trial. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at anytime.</p>
            <p>If you need accomodations for more than 150 active users, please <a href="{{"/contact/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">contact us</a> so that we can create a plan that works for your needs.</p>
